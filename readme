# internship-report-IBENS
As a biology student at the University Pierre and Marie Curie, I did between my first and second years of study, an internship of observation at the « Institut de Biologie de l’École Normale Supérieure » (IBENS). From the 6th June till the 1st of July, I followed four groups of researchers, each during one week.
