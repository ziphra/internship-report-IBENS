# internship report IBENS
This internship gave me the chance to discover the subject of the research these four teams are conducting.

All of them work on neurosciences subjects : the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the biology of neural stem cells (Nathalie Spassky’s team), the cells divisions and the neurogenesis (Xavier Morin’s team), the glutamate receptors and the excitatory synapses (Pierre Paoletti’s team), and finally the zebra-fish neuroethology (German Sumbre’s team). 
So it is to the study of the most (I believe), fascinating and complex object we know in the world : the brain, that these teams contribute to.
