# internship report IBENS
As a biology student at the University Pierre and Marie Curie, I did between my first and second years of study, an internship of observation at the « Institut de Biologie de l’École Normale Supérieure » (IBENS). From the 6th June till the 1st of July, I followed four groups of researchers, each during one week.

This internship gave me the chance to discover the subject of the research these four teams are conducting.

All of them work on neurosciences subjects : the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the biology of neural stem cells (Nathalie Spassky’s team), the cells divisions and the neurogenesis (Xavier Morin’s team), the glutamate receptors and the excitatory synapses (Pierre Paoletti’s team), and finally the zebra-fish neuroethology (German Sumbre’s team). 
So it is to the study of the most (I believe), fascinating and complex object we know in the world : the brain, that these teams contribute to.
